    "##### Report on Building a Chatbot Using GPT-3.5 and the OpenAI API\n",
    "A simple chatbot model was built using the GPT-3.5 API and the Panel library. The goal of this model is to create an OrderBot for a fast-food restaurant that offers chat-based food ordering services. I tested several conversations with the model and examined its performance in collecting orders and interacting with users. Here is a simple report on the experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Findings: \n",
    "\n",
    "-Primary Functionality:  \n",
    "The chat function worked well in collecting orders from users. The form was fun and answered users' questions about the menu appropriately.\n",
    "The form asked clear questions to verify order details, such as the size and type of additional meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Correct Responses:  \n",
    "When entering requests such as \"I want a burger\" or \"What are the drink options?\", the responses were accurate and direct.\n",
    "The GPT-3.5 model responded flexibly and demonstrated good knowledge of the menu options.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Challenges and Drawbacks:  \n",
    "Hallucination: In some cases, inaccurate responses occurred. For example, when I asked the model, \"I want some sauces,\" it suggested sauces that weren't on the menu.\n",
    "Unclear Requests: Sometimes the model had difficulty interpreting imprecise or vague requests. For example, if a user said, \"I want food,\" the model needed more clarification about exactly what the user wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Recommendations for improvement:  \n",
    "The model should be improved to avoid hallucinations through additional training or more accurate context recognition.\n",
    "Add better validation of unclear user input, so that it requests additional clarification before proceeding."
